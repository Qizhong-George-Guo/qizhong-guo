## About

I am a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rutgers University. My work focuses on how water moves through natural and built environments, with research and teaching spanning stormwater, hydrology, hydraulics, estuarine processes, watershed systems, and integrated water and urban infrastructure.

This website offers an overview of selected research contributions, educational activities, and written materials developed over the course of my career.

## Research Contributions

My research covers urban stormwater and green infrastructure, hydraulics and hydrology, estuarine processes, watershed studies, and integrated systems such as the Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) framework.

This section highlights selected projects, case studies, and conceptual frameworks developed with students and collaborators.

## Reflections & Synthesis

Occasional notes and distillations drawn from past and ongoing work in water and environmental systems, written with an eye toward long-term patterns and lessons learned.

These pieces are added as time and interest permit and are intended to bridge technical details with broader perspectives.
