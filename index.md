## About

I am a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rutgers University. My work focuses on how water moves through natural and built environments, with research and teaching spanning stormwater, hydrology, hydraulics, estuarine processes, watershed systems, and integrated water and urban infrastructure.

The site provides a central record of my academic and professional work, including research contributions, publications, teaching materials, invited talks, and reflections developed over the course of my career.

## Research Contributions

My research spans urban stormwater and green infrastructure; hydraulics and hydrology; estuarine and coastal processes; watershed and basin-scale studies; and integrated systems such as the Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) framework.

Current work emphasizes resilient, sustainable, and equitable water and urban systems across scales—from site-based practices to watershed and regional planning.
