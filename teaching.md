My teaching has focused on water resources and environmental systems, with an emphasis on connecting physical processes, engineering analysis, and practical applications. Over the years at Rutgers, I have taught both graduate and undergraduate courses and supervised the Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory.

## Graduate Courses

At Rutgers University–New Brunswick, I have taught graduate-level courses including:

- **Green Infrastructure for Stormwater Management**  
- **Coastal Engineering**  
- **Sediment Transport**  
- **Analysis of Receiving Water Quality**

I developed **Green Infrastructure for Stormwater Management** as a new graduate course and began teaching it in 2012.

These courses emphasize fundamental principles, modeling tools, and applications to urban water systems, estuarine and coastal environments, and water quality management.

## Undergraduate Teaching

At the undergraduate level, I have taught:

- **Fluid Mechanics** (over the first two decades of my career at Rutgers)  
- **Senior Capstone Design in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering**

The Fluid Mechanics course, together with the associated instructional laboratory, has introduced generations of students to the fundamentals of fluid behavior in engineering contexts. The Senior Capstone Design course has provided an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge across hydrology, hydraulics, design, and environmental considerations.

## Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory

Since joining Rutgers, I have supervised the **Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory**, which provides hands-on experiments related to:

- pressure and forces in fluids,  
- flow in pipes and open channels, and  
- fundamental hydraulic concepts such as energy and momentum.

The lab complements classroom learning and helps students build intuition about flow behavior in practical systems.

## Broader Mentorship

Beyond formal courses, I have advised graduate and undergraduate students, supported senior design projects, and contributed to professional and collaborative activities in water resources and environmental engineering. Increasingly, mentorship also involves sharing synthesized insights, materials, and perspectives with wider audiences beyond the classroom.
