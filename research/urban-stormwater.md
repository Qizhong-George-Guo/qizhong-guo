# Urban Stormwater & Green Infrastructure

Urban stormwater systems link rainfall, hydrology, hydraulics, and the built environment. Work in this area examines how rainfall interacts with urban surfaces, how stormwater can be managed through engineered and nature-based practices, and how integrated strategies support pluvial flood resilience. These studies span green infrastructure performance, stormwater system behavior, and the role of combined Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) approaches in enhancing resilience in urban environments.

## Research Themes

- Rainfall–runoff processes in urbanized catchments  
- Green infrastructure design, modeling, and performance  
- Permeable pavements and engineered permeable surfaces  
- Green roofs: hydrologic behavior, evapotranspiration, and thermal effects  
- Rain gardens, bioretention systems, and infiltration-based practices  
- Urban flood mitigation under short-duration, high-intensity rainfall  
- Stormwater–watershed interactions and downstream impacts  
- Sponge-city concepts and international applications  
- Laboratory and field monitoring of GI systems  
- Integration of green and grey infrastructure with intelligent tools (GGBI)

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:

- Laboratory and field studies quantifying infiltration, runoff reduction, and storage dynamics in permeable surfaces, green roofs, and rain gardens  
- Modeling studies evaluating green infrastructure performance, hydrologic behavior, and rainfall–runoff response  
- Analyses of urban flood mechanisms under intense rainfall and short-duration storms  
- Evaluation of combined green/grey stormwater systems for urban flood mitigation and resilience  
- Contributions to international knowledge exchange on the sponge-city concept  
- Development of teaching materials and case studies for stormwater management and green infrastructure
