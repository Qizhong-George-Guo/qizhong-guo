# Urban Stormwater & Green Infrastructure

My work in urban stormwater focuses on how rainfall becomes runoff in built environments, how green infrastructure can modify those processes, and how modeling tools can support design, implementation, and evaluation. This area of research connects hydrologic behavior, sustainable drainage practices, and urban flood mitigation.

## Research Themes

- Performance of green infrastructure practices  
- Rainfall–runoff processes in urban settings  
- Permeable pavements, infiltration systems, and green roofs  
- Modeling of hydrologic and hydraulic behavior  
- Sponge-city concepts and applications  
- Urban flood mitigation strategies  
- Long-term monitoring and field-based evaluation  

## Selected Contributions

This work has involved both modeling and field-based studies, including:  
- evaluation of green roof hydrologic performance,  
- studies of permeable surface infiltration capacity,  
- drainage system performance under extreme rainfall, and  
- integration of nature-based practices within stormwater planning frameworks.
