# Urban Stormwater & Green Infrastructure

Urban stormwater systems provide a foundation for understanding many aspects of hydrology, hydraulics, green infrastructure performance, and urban flood resilience. My work in this area focuses on how rainfall interacts with the built environment, how stormwater can be managed through engineered and nature-based systems, and how Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) approaches can improve resilience in cities.

## Research Themes

- Rainfall–runoff processes in urbanized catchments  
- Green infrastructure design, modeling, and performance  
- Permeable pavements and engineered permeable surfaces  
- Green roofs: hydrologic behavior, evapotranspiration, thermal effects  
- Rain gardens, bioretention systems, and infiltration-based practices  
- Urban flood mitigation under intense rainfall (pluvial flooding)  
- Stormwater–watershed interactions and downstream impacts  
- Sponge-city concepts and international applications  
- Laboratory and field monitoring of GI systems  
- Integration of GI with grey infrastructure and smart tools (GGBS)

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:

- Laboratory and field studies quantifying infiltration, runoff reduction, and storage dynamics in permeable surfaces, green roofs, and rain gardens  
- Modeling studies evaluating green infrastructure performance, hydrologic behavior, and rainfall–runoff response  
- Analysis of urban flood mechanisms under short-duration, high-intensity rainfall  
- Evaluation of combined green/grey systems for stormwater management and urban resilience  
- Contributions to international knowledge exchange on the sponge-city concept  
- Development of teaching materials and case studies for stormwater management and green infrastructure

Selected publications for this topic will be added here, including representative papers on hydrologic modeling, green infrastructure performance, and stormwater system behavior.
