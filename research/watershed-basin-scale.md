# Watershed & Basin-Scale Environmental Studies

Watersheds connect upland hydrologic processes with downstream rivers, estuaries, and coastal systems. My work in this area focuses on hydrology, sediment processes, river–estuary linkages, environmental restoration, and large-scale planning for resilience. These studies integrate hydrologic, hydraulic, ecological, and management perspectives and align closely with the Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) approach to system-level resilience.

## Research Themes

- Watershed hydrology, rainfall–runoff processes, and flow generation  
- Riverine hydraulics, sediment transport, and channel–floodplain dynamics  
- Linkages between watershed conditions and estuarine/coastal responses  
- Water quality, ecosystem processes, and environmental restoration  
- Watershed-scale flood risk, multi-hazard interactions, and mitigation strategies  
- Basin-scale planning and long-term environmental strategies  
- Effects of land use, climate variability, and watershed management practices  
- Integrated assessment frameworks combining science, engineering, and policy  

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:

- Analyses of watershed hydrology, sediment dynamics, and river–estuary interactions  
- Studies of long-term flood risk, resilience strategies, and watershed-scale management  
- Applied work on major systems, such as the Mississippi River Basin and tributary watersheds  
- Environmental planning efforts addressing resilience, restoration, and system-wide impacts  
- Integration of watershed modeling with downstream estuarine and coastal process studies  
- Contributions to multi-scale synthesis connecting inland hydrology to coastal resilience  
- Development of conceptual and planning frameworks for watershed-scale resilience
