# Watershed & Basin-Scale Environmental Studies

This area of work examines water and environmental processes at larger spatial scales, including river basins, estuary–river systems, and regional environmental planning efforts. The emphasis is on long-term trends, multi-scale interactions, and integrated strategies that support resilience and restoration.

## Research Themes

- Watershed hydrology and river system interactions  
- Linking riverine, estuarine, and coastal processes  
- Long-term watershed resilience and planning  
- Restoration and environmental management strategies  
- Mississippi River Basin studies  
- Climate, land use, and hydrologic change at regional scales  

## Selected Contributions

Examples include:  
- Basin-wide synthesis efforts for the Mississippi River Basin  
- Studies linking fluvial inputs to estuarine responses  
- Assessments of regional water and environmental trends  
- Integrated planning approaches across watershed and coastal interfaces
