# Estuarine Processes & Environmental Systems

My research in estuarine processes focuses on the physical dynamics of estuaries and tidally influenced coastal systems. These studies explore how tides, flows, and sediment interact across channels, bays, and wetlands, and how these processes influence environmental and ecological conditions.

## Research Themes

- Tidal motion and propagation  
- Estuary–ocean exchange  
- Bay–marsh flow and sediment exchange  
- Hydrodynamic processes influencing estuarine habitats  
- Support for coastal wetland and estuarine restoration  
- Linkages between hydrodynamics, sediment, and environmental conditions  

## Selected Contributions

Examples include studies of:  
- tidal propagation and flow adjustment in estuarine channels,  
- interactions among bays, tidal flats, and marsh systems,  
- sediment transport affecting wetland morphology, and  
- hydrodynamic conditions supporting restoration or conservation planning.

## Related Publications

Selected papers and reports related to estuarine work will be added here.
