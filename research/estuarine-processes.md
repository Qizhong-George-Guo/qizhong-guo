# Estuarine Processes & Environmental Systems

My research in estuarine processes focuses on the physical dynamics of estuaries and tidally influenced coastal systems. These studies examine how tides, flows, and sediment interact across channels, bays, marshes, and wetlands, and how these processes influence environmental, ecological, and management outcomes.

## Research Themes

- Tidal motion and propagation  
- Estuary–ocean exchange and salinity dynamics  
- Bay–marsh flow, sediment exchange, and wetland stability  
- Hydrodynamic processes shaping estuarine habitats and morphology  
- Physical processes supporting coastal wetland and estuarine restoration  
- Linkages between hydrodynamics, sediment processes, and environmental conditions  
- Interactions between upriver freshwater inflows and coastal forcing  

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:

- Studies of tidal propagation and flow adjustment in estuarine channels  
- Analyses of interactions among bays, tidal flats, and marsh systems  
- Research on sediment transport affecting coastal wetland morphology and resilience  
- Hydrodynamic and sediment studies used to support restoration and conservation planning  
- Integration of estuarine processes with watershed and coastal system analyses  

## Related Publications

Selected papers and reports related to estuarine hydrodynamics, sediment processes, and coastal environmental systems will be added here.
