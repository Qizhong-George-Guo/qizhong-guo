# Estuarine & Coastal Processes

Estuarine and coastal systems sit at the interface between watersheds and the ocean, where tides, river flows, waves, storm surge, and sediment processes interact across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. My work in this area focuses on understanding the physics of these environments and how natural dynamics and human interventions influence water levels, circulation, sediment exchange, wetlands, and coastal resilience.

This research connects directly with stormwater, watershed, and coastal hazard work, and contributes to integrated approaches such as the Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) Framework.

## Research Themes

- Tidal motion, tidal propagation, and estuarine circulation  
- Estuary–ocean exchange and salinity intrusion  
- Bay–marsh interactions, wetland hydrodynamics, and sediment deposition/erosion  
- Wave dynamics, nearshore processes, and coastal morphology  
- Storm surge dynamics and coastal flooding  
- Multi-hazard interactions in estuarine and coastal zones  
- Coupled watershed–estuary–coast system behavior  
- Effects of infrastructure, dredging, and restoration interventions  
- Modeling of tides, waves, surge, sediment transport, and estuarine flows  

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:

- Modeling of tidal propagation, water levels, circulation, and salinity in estuaries and tidal rivers

- Analysis of wave–current interactions, nearshore processes, and shoreline change  
- Investigation of storm surge behavior and coastal flooding impacts  
- Evaluation of watershed influences on estuarine and coastal conditions  
- Contributions to synthesis efforts linking inland hydrology with estuarine and coastal dynamics
