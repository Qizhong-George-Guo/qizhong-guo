# Integrated Water & Urban Systems (GGBS Framework)

The **Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) Framework** reflects a systems-based approach to managing water and urban environments. It integrates natural processes, engineered infrastructure, smart technologies, and community needs to support resilience across pluvial, fluvial, and coastal contexts.

## Research Themes

- Integrated water and urban system planning  
- Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) infrastructure  
- Multi-hazard resilience (pluvial–fluvial–coastal)  
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis and systems thinking  
- Nature-based and engineered solutions  
- Smart, data-informed tools for resilience planning  

## Selected Contributions

This area brings together insights from stormwater, hydraulics, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. Examples include:

- Development of integrated resilience strategies  
- Conceptual frameworks linking infrastructure types  
- Basin-scale synthesis efforts  
- Applied work in both U.S. and international settings  

## Related Publications

Selected publications illustrating the GGBS approach will be added here.
