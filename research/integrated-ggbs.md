# Integrated Water & Urban Systems (GGBS Framework)

The Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) framework reflects a systems-based approach to managing water and urban environments. It connects natural processes, engineered infrastructure, digital tools, and community needs to support resilience across pluvial, fluvial, and coastal contexts.

## Research Themes

- Integrated water and urban system planning  
- Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) infrastructure  
- Multi-hazard resilience (pluvial–fluvial–coastal)  
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis and systems thinking  
- Nature-based and engineered solutions  
- Digital and data-driven tools for resilience planning  

## Selected Contributions

This area brings together insights from stormwater, hydraulics, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. Examples include:  
- development of integrated resilience strategies,  
- conceptual frameworks linking infrastructure types,  
- basin-scale synthesis efforts, and  
- applied work in both U.S. and international settings.
