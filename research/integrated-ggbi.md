# Integrated Water & Urban Systems (GGBI Framework)

The **Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework** reflects a systems-based approach to managing water and urban environments.  
It integrates natural processes, engineered infrastructure, intelligent technologies, and community needs to support resilience across pluvial, fluvial, and coastal contexts.

## Research Themes

- Integrated water and urban system planning  
- Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) infrastructure  
- Multi-hazard resilience (pluvial–fluvial–coastal)  
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis and systems thinking  
- Nature-based and engineered solutions  
- Intelligent, data-informed tools for resilience planning  

## Selected Contributions

This area brings together insights from stormwater, hydraulics, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. Examples include:

- development of integrated resilience strategies,  
- conceptual frameworks linking infrastructure types,  
- basin-scale synthesis efforts, and  
- applied work in both U.S. and international settings.  

## Related Publications

Selected publications illustrating the GGBI approach will be added here.
