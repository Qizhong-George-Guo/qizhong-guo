# Hydraulics, Hydrology & Hydroinformatics

This work examines the movement of water in natural and engineered systems, using analytical methods, numerical models, and data-driven tools. Hydraulics and hydrology provide a foundation for many of my studies in urban drainage, river flow, coastal systems, and integrated water management.

## Research Themes

- Flow dynamics in natural and engineered channels  
- Hydrologic–hydraulic modeling  
- Urban drainage and stormwater system analysis  
- Computational and numerical modeling  
- Hydroinformatics and data-assisted decision support  
- Design storm analysis and flood hydrology  
- Engineering tools for water systems planning  

## Selected Contributions

Examples of work in this area include:  
- Hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling for planning and design,  
- Stormwater system capacity assessment,  
- Development and application of decision-support tools, and  
- Integration of environmental data within hydraulic analyses.

## Related Publications

Selected papers and reports relevant to this area will be included here.
