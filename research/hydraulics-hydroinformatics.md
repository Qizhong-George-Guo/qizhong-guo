# Hydraulics, Hydrology & Hydroinformatics

Hydraulics, hydrology, and hydroinformatics form the analytical foundation for much of my work in stormwater, rivers, estuaries, and broader water systems. These topics address how water flows through natural and engineered environments, how hydrologic and hydraulic processes interact across scales, and how computational and data-informed tools support analysis, planning, and design.

This theme links closely with other research areas, including urban stormwater, watershed processes, and estuarine and coastal dynamics, and contributes directly to integrated approaches such as the Green–Grey–Blue–Smart (GGBS) Framework.

## Research Themes

- Open-channel flow, river hydraulics, and environmental fluid mechanics  
- Hydrologic and hydraulic modeling of urban and natural watersheds  
- Stormwater system evaluation and performance assessment  
- Numerical modeling of flow, transport, and environmental processes  
- Hydroinformatics and environmental data analysis  
- Modeling-supported decision tools for planning and design  
- Interactions among hydrology, hydraulics, and multi-hazard resilience  
- Linkages between catchment processes and downstream estuarine/coastal dynamics  

## Selected Contributions

Representative areas of work include:

- Hydrologic–hydraulic modeling of stormwater systems, river reaches, and watershed-scale processes  
- Development and application of models for evaluating flow, water levels, and environmental conditions in rivers and estuaries  
- Analysis of hydrologic responses to land use, rainfall patterns, and management practices  
- Integration of hydrologic/hydraulic modeling with green infrastructure and hybrid (green–grey–blue) systems  
- Use of environmental data and computational tools to support engineering design and planning  
- Contributions to interdisciplinary collaboration in watershed, estuarine, and coastal studies
