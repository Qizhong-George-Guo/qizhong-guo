This page lists **full papers published in conference proceedings**. Papers published by professional societies, such as the American Society of Civil Engineers, are typically peer-reviewed prior to publication. Additional items will be added over time. As with other sections of this faculty site, it serves as the primary and most complete record of my scholarly work, including materials not captured in conventional academic indexes.
