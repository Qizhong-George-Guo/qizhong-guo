# Technical Reports

This section documents applied and project-based technical work, including collaborative studies, planning reports, and agency-supported investigations completed over the years. These reports emphasize the translation of scientific and engineering knowledge into practice. Additional materials will be added as reports are archived and organized.

Examples of technical report topics include:

- stormwater and hydrologic evaluations,

- estuarine, tidal, and coastal system analyses,

- watershed restoration and environmental assessments,

- flood resilience, adaptation, and planning efforts, and

- applied studies conducted for government agencies and interdisciplinary research teams.
