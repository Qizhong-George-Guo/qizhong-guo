# Research Contributions

My research examines how water moves through natural and built environments and how engineering, environmental, and planning processes interact across scales. Over the years, this work has included urban stormwater and green infrastructure, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, estuarine and coastal processes, watershed studies, and integrated approaches to urban and coastal resilience.

The five areas below reflect the major threads of my work and align with the Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework developed for integrated water and urban environments. Each topic links to a subpage with selected examples and publications.

## 1. Urban Stormwater & Green Infrastructure  
Research on rainfall–runoff processes, green infrastructure performance, permeable surfaces, green roofs, rain gardens, and sponge-city concepts, with emphasis on hydrologic behavior, field and laboratory studies, modeling, and urban flood mitigation.

## 2. Hydraulics, Hydrology & Hydroinformatics  
Studies involving flow dynamics, hydrologic–hydraulic modeling, stormwater system evaluation, environmental data analysis, and computational tools. Topics include urban drainage, river hydraulics, and data-informed decision support for water systems.

## 3. Estuarine & Coastal Processes  
Research on tides, tidal propagation, estuary–ocean exchange, bay–marsh interactions, sediment transport, storm surge processes, coastal wetlands, and the environmental dynamics that shape estuaries and coastal systems.

## 4. Watershed & Basin-Scale Environmental Studies  
Work on river systems, watershed hydrology, estuary–river linkages, environmental restoration, flood resilience, and large-scale planning. Examples include studies related to the Mississippi River Basin and long-term environmental strategies.

## 5. Integrated Water & Urban Systems (GGBI Framework)  
A synthesis-based approach integrating natural processes, engineered infrastructure, blue systems, and intelligent tools. The **Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework** connects hydrology, hydraulics, stormwater, estuarine processes, and urban resilience across pluvial, fluvial, and coastal domains.

## Purpose of This Section

This page organizes the major themes that have shaped my research over time. Subpages provide selected examples and representative publications. The emphasis is on clarity, organization, and connections across topics rather than exhaustive documentation.
