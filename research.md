# Research Contributions

My research examines how water moves through natural and built environments and how engineering, environmental, and planning processes interact across different scales. Over the years, this work has included stormwater and green infrastructure systems, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, estuarine processes, watershed studies, and integrated approaches to urban and coastal resilience.

This page provides an overview of the main areas in which I have worked. Each section links to a more detailed page with additional examples and selected publications.

## 1. Urban Stormwater & Green Infrastructure  
Research on rainfall–runoff processes, green infrastructure performance, permeable surfaces, green roofs, and sponge-city concepts, with emphasis on modeling, hydrologic behavior, and urban flood mitigation.

## 2. Hydraulics, Hydrology & Hydroinformatics  
Work involving flow dynamics, hydrologic–hydraulic modeling, stormwater system evaluation, environmental data analysis, and computational tools for supporting planning and design.

## 3. Estuarine Processes & Environmental Systems  
Studies of physical processes in estuaries and tidally influenced coastal systems, including tidal motion and propagation, estuary–ocean exchange, bay–marsh flow and sediment exchange, and the environmental dynamics that support estuarine and coastal wetland systems.

## 4. Watershed & Basin-Scale Environmental Studies  
Research on river systems, estuary–river interactions, environmental restoration, and watershed-scale resilience strategies. Examples include work related to the Mississippi River Basin and long-term environmental planning.

## 5. Integrated Water & Urban Systems (GGBI Framework) 
  
A systems-based approach integrating natural processes, engineered infrastructure, and intelligent tools.  
The Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) Framework connects hydrology, hydraulics, stormwater, estuarine processes, and urban resilience.

## Purpose of This Section

This page organizes the major themes that have shaped my research over time. Subpages include selected examples and representative publications for each area. The emphasis is on clarity, organization, and connections across topics rather than exhaustive documentation.
