The laboratory and instructional facilities I have used at Rutgers have supported coursework, student learning, senior design projects, and selected research activities in water resources, hydraulics, stormwater systems, and environmental processes. While my recent work has focused more on synthesis, modeling, and broader environmental systems, these facilities have played an important role throughout my teaching and scholarly activities.

This page provides an overview of the primary facilities I have worked with over the years.

## Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory (UCWS Lab)

The Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory (UCWS Lab) was created during the construction of Richard Weeks Hall of Engineering in 2018. I designated the laboratory as “UCWS” to reflect its expanded role, integrating the traditional **Fluid Mechanics Laboratory** with the **Hydroinformatics Laboratory** that I established in 2000. The space was sized and configured according to my specifications to support specific instructional and research needs. The facility’s infrastructure and major instrumentation—such as the hydraulic flume—were funded through donor and university support to enhance our experimental capabilities.

In this lab, I have used equipment for demonstrating fluid flow concepts, visualizing hydraulic processes, and exploring aspects of stormwater and environmental systems. The space has also supported undergraduate and graduate student research projects, laboratory demonstrations, and collaborative studies.

## Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory

Since joining Rutgers, I have supervised the **Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory**, which provides hands-on experience for undergraduate students in the Fluid Mechanics course.

Experiments and instructional modules I have used include:

- demonstrations of fundamental hydraulic principles,  
- measurement of fluid properties (such as density, viscosity, and surface tension),  
- flow measurement devices,  
- flumes and channels for flow visualization, and  
- setups illustrating pressure, momentum, and energy concepts.

This facility has helped many generations of students connect theoretical concepts with physical observations.

## Hydraulics & Environmental Systems Equipment

Depending on instructional or project needs, I have used laboratory equipment such as:

- medium-scale demonstration flumes,  
- rainfall–runoff and infiltration setups,  
- sediment-related and wave-motion demonstration units,  
- environmental sensors and measurement tools (including field-deployed instruments for stormwater runoff quantity and quality monitoring, estuarine flow depth and velocity measurements, and water-quality sensing),  
- computational resources for hydrologic and hydraulic modeling.

These tools have supported classroom instruction, senior design projects, and selected research initiatives.

## Computational and Modeling Resources

In addition to physical facilities, a substantial portion of my work involves computational modeling in hydrology, hydraulics, stormwater systems, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. I have used hydrologic–hydraulic models, coastal and estuarine process models, GIS-based analyses, and decision-support tools for scenario evaluation and planning.

These computational resources complement hands-on instruction by enabling students and researchers to analyze water systems across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

## Purpose of This Section

This summary documents the facilities I have used in teaching, project supervision, and past research activities. Although my current work focuses more on synthesis, modeling, and integrated environmental systems, these laboratory resources continue to provide instructional value and remain part of the broader water resources infrastructure within the department.
