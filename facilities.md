# Facilities

Facilities at Rutgers have supported coursework, instructional activities, and selected research in water resources, hydraulics, and environmental systems. Although recent work has placed greater emphasis on synthesis, modeling, and broader environmental studies, these laboratory resources have contributed to many years of student learning and project-based exploration.

This page provides an overview of the primary facilities associated with past and ongoing work.

## Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory (UCWS Lab)

The Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory was established when Richard Weeks Hall of Engineering opened in 2018, combining two earlier spaces: the long-standing **Fluid Mechanics Laboratory** and the **Hydroinformatics Laboratory** founded in 2000. Together, these facilities support experimental, computational, and educational work related to water and environmental systems.

The lab includes equipment for demonstrating fluid flow concepts, visualizing hydraulic processes, and exploring selected aspects of stormwater and environmental systems. It has also served as a setting for student research projects and collaborative studies.

## Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory

The **Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory** provides hands-on experience for undergraduate students enrolled in the Fluid Mechanics course. Over the years, this facility has offered students opportunities to connect theoretical principles with physical observations.

The laboratory includes:

- demonstrations of fundamental hydraulic principles  
- flow measurement devices  
- flumes and channels for basic flow visualization  
- instructional modules illustrating pressure, momentum, and energy concepts

## Hydraulics & Environmental Systems Equipment

Depending on instructional or project needs, the laboratory has supported work using:

- small-scale demonstration flumes  
- rainfall–runoff and infiltration setups  
- sediment-related demonstration units  
- environmental sensors and basic monitoring equipment  
- computational tools for hydrologic and hydraulic modeling  

These tools have been used primarily for instructional purposes, senior design projects, and selected research activities.

## Computational and Modeling Resources

In addition to physical facilities, research and teaching frequently involve computational modeling in hydrology, hydraulics, stormwater systems, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. Software tools have included hydrologic–hydraulic models, coastal and estuarine process models, GIS-based analyses, and decision support and scenario evaluation systems.

These computational resources complement instructional laboratories by supporting analysis across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

## Purpose of This Section

This summary documents the instructional and research facilities that have supported teaching and scholarship over the years. While current work focuses more on synthesis, modeling, and broader environmental systems, laboratory resources continue to provide educational value and form part of the department’s water resources infrastructure.
