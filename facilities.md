# Facilities

The laboratory and instructional facilities I have worked with at Rutgers support both coursework and research in water resources, hydraulics, and environmental systems. Although my current work is less centered on physical experimentation, these facilities have contributed to many years of teaching, student learning, and selected research activities.

This page provides a brief overview of the primary facilities associated with my work.

## Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory (UCWS Lab)

The Urban & Coastal Water Systems Laboratory was established when the Richard Weeks Hall of Engineering opened in 2018, combining two earlier facilities: the long-standing **Fluid Mechanics Laboratory** and the **Hydroinformatics Laboratory** founded in 2000. Together, these spaces support experimental, computational, and educational activities related to water and environmental systems.

The lab includes equipment for demonstrating fluid flow concepts, visualizing hydraulic processes, and exploring selected aspects of stormwater and environmental systems. It has also served as a setting for student research projects and collaborative studies.

## Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory

Since joining Rutgers, I have supervised the **Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory**, which provides hands-on experience for undergraduate students enrolled in the Fluid Mechanics course.

The lab includes:

- experiments demonstrating fundamental hydraulic principles,  
- flow measurement devices,  
- flumes and channels for basic flow visualization, and  
- instructional modules for understanding pressure, momentum, and energy concepts.

This facility has helped generations of students connect theoretical principles with physical observations.

## Hydraulics & Environmental Systems Equipment

Depending on instructional or project needs, the laboratory has supported work using:

- small-scale demonstration flumes,  
- rainfall–runoff and infiltration setups,  
- sediment-related demonstration units,  
- environmental sensors and basic monitoring equipment, and  
- computational tools for hydrologic and hydraulic modeling.

These tools have been used primarily for instructional purposes, senior design projects, and selected research activities over the years.

## Computational and Modeling Resources

In addition to physical facilities, much of my research and teaching involves computational modeling in hydrology, hydraulics, stormwater systems, estuarine processes, and watershed studies. Software tools have included hydrologic–hydraulic models, coastal and estuarine process models, GIS-based analyses, and decision support and scenario evaluation systems.

These computational resources complement the instructional laboratory by supporting analysis across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

## Purpose of This Section

This summary is intended to document the facilities that have supported teaching and scholarship over the years. While current work focuses more on synthesis, modeling, and broader environmental systems, the laboratory resources continue to provide educational value for students and form part of the broader water resources infrastructure within the department.
