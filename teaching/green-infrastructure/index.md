## Course Overview
Green Infrastructure for Water Management is a graduate-level course centered on stormwater management as the foundation for a broader, integrated approach to water resources. It combines hydrology, water quality, planning and regulation, and engineering design, with strong emphasis on real-world practices, regulatory requirements, and environmental performance. The course extends beyond stormwater to include wastewater, drinking water sustainability, energy recovery, and life-cycle environmental impacts, balancing theory with practical analysis and independent inquiry.
