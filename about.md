## Short Biography

I am a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. My work focuses on how water moves through natural and built environments, with research spanning stormwater management, hydraulics and hydrology, estuarine processes, watershed systems, and integrated approaches to water and urban resilience.

Over more than three decades at Rutgers, I have worked on topics including green infrastructure design and performance, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, tidal and estuarine processes, watershed restoration, and integrated systems frameworks such as Green–Grey–Blue–Intelligent (GGBI) infrastructure. I have taught graduate and undergraduate courses in green infrastructure, coastal engineering, hydrology, stormwater systems, and fluid mechanics, and have supervised the Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory for many years.

My recent interests include synthesizing lessons from long-term work in water systems, exploring integrated resilience strategies across scales, and using emerging AI tools to support engineering education, communication, and knowledge distillation.

My Chinese name is 郭祺忠.

A concise curriculum vitae is available on the [**Short CV page**](/cv/), including a downloadable PDF version.

## Full Biography

Qizhong (George) Guo is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rutgers University. Since joining Rutgers, he has contributed to a broad range of research and teaching activities in water resources and environmental engineering, including stormwater management, urban hydrology, hydraulics, hydrodynamic modeling, estuarine processes, and watershed-scale environmental studies.

His research has included work on green infrastructure performance and modeling, rainfall–runoff processes, urban flood mitigation, tidal and estuarine circulation, bay–marsh interactions, and coastal wetland restoration. He has collaborated with students, colleagues, agencies, and multidisciplinary teams on projects addressing flooding, storm surge impacts, ecosystem processes, and long-term watershed resilience.

At Rutgers, he has taught graduate courses such as  
- **Green Infrastructure for Stormwater Management**,
- **Coastal Engineering**,
- **Sediment Transport**, and  
- **Analysis of Receiving Water Quality**,  

as well as undergraduate courses including  
- **Fluid Mechanics** and  
- **Senior Capstone Design in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering**.

He also supervised the **Fluid Mechanics Instructional Laboratory** for more than three decades, providing hands-on experimental learning for undergraduate students.

Beyond the university, his work has engaged with broader professional and public audiences through invited talks, technical reports, media interviews, and applied studies in the United States and China. His recent efforts increasingly emphasize synthesis—integrating concepts across hydrology, hydraulics, estuarine processes, and urban systems—and exploring the potential role of AI in engineering education and communication.
