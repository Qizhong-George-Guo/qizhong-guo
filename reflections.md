title: "Reflections & Synthesis"
permalink: /reflections
---

This section presents occasional reflections drawn from experiences in teaching, research, professional practice, and long-term engagement with water and environmental systems. These pieces are added gradually and without a fixed schedule. They aim to distill ideas, connect themes across disciplines, and offer broader perspectives shaped by recurring patterns observed over many years.

The emphasis is on clarity, synthesis, and thoughtful observation rather than frequent updates. As time allows, topics may include insights related to stormwater and green infrastructure, estuarine and coastal systems, watershed and basin-scale processes, integrated resilience strategies, teaching experiences, and emerging tools such as AI in engineering education and communication.

## Recent Reflections

New reflections will be added here as they are developed. This space is intended for longer-form synthesis and perspective pieces written specifically for this faculty website.

Some reflections may also be selectively shared on LinkedIn, while others—particularly more exploratory or opinionated pieces—will remain exclusive to this site.

## Related Public Commentary

In addition to the reflections presented here, selected perspectives related to my work have appeared in public-facing formats, including op-ed articles and media interviews. The op-ed pieces represent fully authored commentary, while the media interviews reflect shorter expert input as interpreted and presented by journalists. These materials are listed separately on this site for reference and context.

## Purpose of This Section

The goal of *Reflections & Synthesis* is to provide space for ideas that do not fit easily into conventional academic publications—ideas that bridge disciplines, summarize lessons from practice, or offer perspectives informed by long-term engagement with water and environmental systems.

Rather than delivering exhaustive analysis, these reflections highlight connections, recurring themes, and broader insights that may be useful to students, colleagues, practitioners, or others interested in the interplay between engineering, environment, and society.
